Can you give me the full recipe for Apple Butter?,"Here is the full recipe for Apple Butter:
Ingredients: 10 pounds apples, quartered, 4 cups unsweetened apple juice, 1 cup white sugar, 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon, ½ teaspoon ground cloves, ½ teaspoon ground allspice, 6  half-pint canning jars with lids and rings
Servings: 48
Prep time: 10 mins
Cook time: 10 hrs 25 mins
Directions: Combine apples and apple juice in a stockpot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook at a simmer until apples are soft and mushy, 20 to 30 minutes.
Spoon apples into a food mill and process into puree while discarding the cores and peels remaining in the mill. Transfer process apples to a slow cooker.
Cook on High with the lid off until the moisture evaporates and the volume reduces by about half, overnight to 24 hours.
Stir sugar, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice through the apple puree.
Continue cooking on High until mixture mounds on a chilled plate without any water separating from the edges, another 2 to 6 hours.
Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the apple butter into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process 5 to 10 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Can you break down the steps to cook Apple Butter?,"To prepare Apple Butter, follow these steps: 
Combine apples and apple juice in a stockpot; bring to a boil
 Reduce heat and cook at a simmer until apples are soft and mushy, 20 to 30 minutes

Spoon apples into a food mill and process into puree while discarding the cores and peels remaining in the mill
 Transfer process apples to a slow cooker

Cook on High with the lid off until the moisture evaporates and the volume reduces by about half, overnight to 24 hours

Stir sugar, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice through the apple puree

Continue cooking on High until mixture mounds on a chilled plate without any water separating from the edges, another 2 to 6 hours

Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes
 Pack the apple butter into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top
 Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles
 Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue
 Top with lids, and screw on rings

Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water
 Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder
 Leave a 2-inch space between the jars
 Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars
 Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process 5 to 10 minutes

Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool
 Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all)
 Store in a cool, dark area

Directions: Place cherries, apple juice, lemon juice, and pectin into a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, and mix in the sugar. Cook the jam at a rolling boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim off any foam.
Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the cherry jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes, or the time as recommended by your county Extension agent.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Ingredients: ½ cup coarsely chopped prunes, ¼ cup currants, 2 tablespoons creme de cassis liqueur, 1 ½ tablespoons minced fresh rosemary, 1 ½ tablespoons minced fresh thyme, ½ teaspoon ground coriander, 1 ¼ teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 1 (4 pound) boneless leg of lamb, rolled and tied, ½ cup chopped roasted and salted almonds, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint, 3 cloves garlic, cut into thirds, 2 tablespoons olive oil, ½ cup balsamic vinegar, 5 tablespoons butter, 3 tablespoons honey, ⅓ cup thinly sliced, stemmed Calimyrna figs, 5 teaspoons chopped fresh basil, 6 leaves mint, 6 leaves basil
Servings: 6
Prep time: 50 mins
Cook time: 1 hrs
Directions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine the chopped prunes and currants with the creme de cassis in a small bowl, and set aside. In another small bowl, combine the rosemary, thyme, coriander, salt, and pepper; set aside.
Untie and unroll the lamb, lay it out flat on the work surface. Trim off excess fat, and cut any thick parts open so that it is evenly thick and somewhat rectangular in shape. Sprinkle half of the herb mixture over the lamb. Mix the almonds and chopped mint into the prune mixture; spread evenly over the lamb. Roll up starting at one of the short sides, and tie with kitchen twine in 1-inch intervals. Cut 9 slits about 1-inch deep into the top of the lamb, and insert a slice of garlic in each. Rub with olive oil, and sprinkle with the remaining herb mixture.
Place lamb seam-side up on a rack set in a roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven to desired doneness. For medium-rare, a thermometer inserted into the center will read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove lamb from the oven and cover with foil. Allow to rest for 15 minutes while proceeding with the recipe.
While the lamb is resting, bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Boil until the vinegar has reduced by half, 4 to 5 minutes. Once reduced, stir in the butter, honey, and sliced figs. Stir until the butter has melted, then remove from the heat, stir in the chopped basil and set aside.
To serve, remove the twine from the lamb and cut into 1/2 inch thick slices. Arrange on a warm serving platter and drizzle with the fig sauce, garnish with mint and basil leaves.

Ingredients: 3 cups fresh figs, stemmed and quartered, 3 cups white sugar, 1  lemon, thinly sliced and seeds removed, 2 (3 ounce) packages strawberry-flavored Jell-O® mix, 3  1-pint canning jars with lids and rings, or as needed
Servings: 36
Prep time: 30 mins
Cook time: 35 mins
Directions: Mix figs, sugar, lemon slices, and strawberry gelatin in a large pot. Let stand for 1 hour. Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat, stirring often to prevent burning, until foam has disappeared and the preserves are thickened, 25 to 40 minutes.
Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the fig preserves into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 2 days before opening.

Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Can you give me the full recipe for Mahi Mahi with Coconut Rice and Mango Salsa?,"Here is the full recipe for Mahi Mahi with Coconut Rice and Mango Salsa:
Ingredients: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 ½ teaspoons soy sauce, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, 1 clove garlic, crushed, 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper , ½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger root, 2 tablespoons chopped green onion (Optional),   salt to taste, 4 (4 ounce) mahi mahi fillets, 2 cups uncooked jasmine rice, 2 cups water, 1 cube chicken bouillon, 1 tablespoon butter (Optional), ¾ (14 ounce) can coconut milk, 2 tablespoons white sugar, 1 ½ teaspoons butter (Optional), 1 ½ tablespoons white sugar, 1 ½ cups fresh mango, cubed
Servings: 4
Prep time: 30 mins
Cook time: 30 mins
Directions: Whisk together the olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic, red pepper flakes, black pepper, ginger, green onion, and salt in a bowl. Add the mahi mahi and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack in the middle of the oven.
Bring the rice, water, chicken bouillon, and 1 tablespoon butter to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Stir, and simmer uncovered until the rice has absorbed most of the coconut milk.
While the rice is cooking, remove the mahi mahi from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Place fish in a large baking dish in a single layer. Broil in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes. If the fish browns too quickly, cover the baking dish with a sheet of aluminum foil.
Melt 1 1/2 teaspoons butter and 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar in a skillet over medium-high heat. When the mixture begins to bubble, stir in mango cubes. Cook and stir until mango is tender, about 5 minutes. Serve by placing a mahi mahi fillet over a scoop of hot rice and top with the mango salsa.

Ingredients: 2 ¼ cups diced fresh mango, ¼ cup salt, 2 ½ cups water, 2 ⅓ cups white sugar, 2 cups vinegar, ½ cup raisins, ½ cup chopped pitted dates, 2  cinnamon sticks, 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root, 2 teaspoons crushed garlic, 2 teaspoons ground dried chile pepper, 10  half-pint canning jars with lids and rings
Servings: 24
Prep time: 30 mins
Cook time: 1 hrs 10 mins
Directions: Put mango into a large bowl. Sprinkle salt over the mango. Pour water over the mango. Let mango soak for 1 hour to overnight.
Drain and discard liquid from the mango.
Stir sugar and vinegar together in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Add drained mango to the liquid; stir to coat. Stir raisins, dates, cinnamon sticks, ginger, garlic, and ground dried chile pepper into the mango mixture; bring again to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and simmer mixture until thickened, about 1 hour. Remove from heat to cool completely.
Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack chutney into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.
Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes.
Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.

Servings: 48
Prep time: 45 mins
Cook time: 30 mins
Directions: Mix semolina flour, all-purpose flour, mahlab, and salt together in a large bowl. Work clarified butter into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until thoroughly incorporated. Cover bowl and let dough rest at room temperature, 8 hours to overnight.
Pour milk into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until just warm, about 15 seconds. Stir in sugar and yeast until dissolved. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Pour yeast mixture and orange blossom water over the dough and mix until evenly moistened. Pinch off a piece of dough and roll into a ball; it should hold its shape without cracking. Add more milk or orange blossom water if needed. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
Sprinkle some flour over the ma'amoul molds and tap out the excess. Pinch off a walnut-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball. Press your thumb into the ball to create space for the filling. Work the edges with your fingers so the sides are even and fairly thin. Drop in a piece of date paste and pinch dough over it to seal.
Place cookie into the mold cavity seam-side up. Press down so that the top is flush with edges of the mold. Trim off any excess dough. Invert the mold and tap it against your work surface to release the cookie. Repeat with remaining dough and date paste, arranging cookies 1 inch apart on the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven, 1 baking sheet at a time, until edges and bottoms are golden but tops are still mostly pale, about 15 minutes.
Sift powdered sugar over the cookies while still slightly warm. Let cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

How do I make Reshteh Polo (Persian Noodle Rice)?,"To prepare Reshteh Polo (Persian Noodle Rice), follow these steps: 
Place rice in a medium bowl and cover with tepid water
 Gently swish it around with your finger to activate the starches, then tip the bowl to drain water
 Repeat this process until water runs clear, about 7 rinses
 Cover rice with cold water, add 1/2 tablespoon salt, stir gently, and soak for 1 hour
 Drain rice without rinsing

Crush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle
 Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water
 Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside

Fill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 9 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat
 Add 3 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved
 Break roasted noodles into thirds and add to the boiling water with the rice
 Stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over
 Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly
 Cook until the first rice grain pops up to the surface
 Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface, until the timer goes off
 Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more

Drain rice and noodles in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch
 Taste and gently rinse again if too salty
 Set aside to drain completely
 Wash and dry the pot

Place the clean pot over medium heat
 Add oil, 1 tablespoon saffron water, and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with the oil mixture
 Tightly overlap potato slices in a single layer covering the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer

Gently scatter rice-noodle mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure potatoes are completely covered and moving noodles away from the sides of the pot
 Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into the rice and noodles a few times, being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking
 Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set, about 10 minutes

Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup boiling water with 2 tablespoons melted butter and remaining saffron water
 Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface

Test the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon
 When the pot sizzles, remove it from the heat
 Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot
 Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source
 Drizzle the butter mixture over the rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid

Place a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove
 Cook until crispy, rotating the pot a few times, about 35 minutes
 Remove from the heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes so tahdig will release easily

Meanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat
 Add dates, raisins, and cinnamon; sprinkle with a little salt
 Cook and stir until dates are glistening and soft, 3 to 5 minutes

Gently scatter rice on a platter and remove potato tahdig pieces and serve on the side
 Sprinkle raisin-date sauce over top
