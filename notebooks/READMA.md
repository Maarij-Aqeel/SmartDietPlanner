## Notes

You are welcome to explore the notebook and test with the model, but I would recommend not pushing any significant changes made to the model pushed directly to this branch as it can later cause conflict issues. \

The intended files for the model (for now) are:
- the finetuned model GGUF file
- the ollama python library
