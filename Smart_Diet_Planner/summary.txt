1. Added pandas to requirements so run this first:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. migrate all changes before hand:
    py manage.py makemigrations
    py manage.py migrate

Changes:
    - United the media path of all the apps:
        so now all media is in the media folder instead of the static files of each app.
        the image path also changed from {% static ... %} -> /media/ <filename or the further directory>
        all the css/js files are still static only the media have changed
        if any image dosen't load check its path. e.g:  /media/Diet_logo.png
        Will reduce redundancy and was neccesary because the recipe images maybe used in multiple apps

    - For some reason when importing the model it didn't recognize the recipe app or the Recipie model.
        added a few lined of code in top of manage.py so the importing works.
        will not affect the project or anything just mentioned here

Added:
    - Added the Recipie model:
        Model contains the same fields as in the csv file
        image field have the image name and when accessing it /media/recipie/<recipie:Recipie.image> (smthing like this) should be used
        Cook time have Null values so its missing field is None

    - Admin panel:
        Configured the model in admin panel so we should be able to view/sort/filter/delete recipies from there
        and it looks cool

    - Importing Command:
        Initialy the dataset won't be loaded. You need to load it manually.
        I used management command and pandas to load the csv just run this command and the data set will be loaded:
            py manage.py import_csv dataset.csv
        the csv file is under management/commands directory. The reason being that the argument at first was path so each members needs to save the file
        and give their respective path, it whould just add more work. Its easier this way also if any changes are done to csv in future we all whould have same copy via git.

btw if you have SQLlite installed you can see model there(db.sqlite3 file) as well. I dont but the yt guy had installed. we can also query from SQL lite a well if needed.
